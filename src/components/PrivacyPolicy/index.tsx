            </p>

                We take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures include encryption, firewalls, and secure server technologies. However, no internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error-free, so please take special care in deciding what information you send to us.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-body-color">5. Data Retention</h2>

                We retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. After this period, we will delete or anonymize your data unless we are required to retain it by law.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-body-color">6. Your Rights</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-body-color">
                We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with applicable data protection laws. However, due to the nature of our services—primarily Automated Valuation Models (AVM) for real estate valuation, which do not involve legal document verification or in-depth property analysis—certain limitations apply to the rights you may have regarding your personal data.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-body-color">
                <li><strong>Access:</strong> You may request access to the personal information you have provided directly to us. However, please note that we do not share or disclose any internal property data, valuation opinions, or related proprietary information that is part of our AVM process.</li>
                <li><strong>Correction:</strong> If any of the personal information you provided is inaccurate or incomplete (such as your contact details), you may request corrections to ensure we hold accurate information.</li>
                <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You may request the deletion of your personal information if it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. However, certain data may be retained for legal, regulatory, or legitimate business purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Objection to Processing:</strong> You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for certain purposes, such as marketing. Please note, however, that data processed for business or regulatory compliance may not be subject to this right.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> While you may request the transfer of your personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used format, this does not extend to any property data, valuation results, or proprietary algorithms used in our AVM process. These remain confidential and are not shared as part of any portability requests.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4 text-body-color">
                It is important to understand that Desktop Valuation does not handle or verify legal property documents, nor do we provide legal opinions on properties. Our services are purely data-driven, based on algorithmic analysis and market data, and we do not release or disclose the specific workings of our valuation models to clients.
