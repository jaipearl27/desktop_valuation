                <li>
                    <strong>Earth Engineers</strong> (Desktop Valuation)<strong>:</strong> A valuation performed remotely without physical inspection of the property, 
                    based on the information provided by the client and other publicly available or proprietary data sources.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Client:</strong> Any individual or organization using this website and requesting a valuation.</li>
                <li><strong>Company:</strong> Desktop Valuation, the entity providing valuation services through this website.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-body-color">2. Services Provided</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-body-color">
                Desktop Valuation services are provided using an Automated Valuation Model (AVM), which 
                generates an estimate based on available data and property characteristics. It is important to note 
                that desktop valuations are based on assumptions and may not be as accurate as a physical 
                valuation. 
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-body-color">
                We offer three types of valuations:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-body-color">
                <li><strong>Market Value:</strong> The estimated amount the property would likely sell for in a competitive and open market.</li>
                <li><strong>Realizable Value:</strong> The estimated price the property could fetch within a reasonable marketing period.</li>
                <li><strong>Distress Value:</strong> The likely value in the case of a forced sale, where time and conditions for marketing the property are limited.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-body-color">3. Use of Valuation Reports</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-body-color">
                The valuation reports provided by Desktop Valuation are for informational purposes only and 
                should not be relied upon for formal financial transactions like securing loans or legal matters unless otherwise explicitly stated.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-body-color">
                The valuation provided is subject to limitations due to the lack of physical inspection and verification of documents.
                We do not verify any property ownership documents or technical aspects related to the property, and as such, 
                we are not liable for any legal or technical issues related to property ownership or documentation.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-body-color">4. Report Validity</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-body-color">
                All valuation reports are valid for 45 days from the date of download. 
                After this period, the report should not be relied upon as the property market and external factors may have changed.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-body-color">5. Limitations of Desktop Valuation</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-body-color">
                A desktop valuation does not involve a site inspection,
                 verification of title documents, or other legal assessments. Therefore, the valuation provided may differ from a 
                 physical valuation and should be treated as an estimate.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-body-color">
                The Automated Valuation Model (AVM) is based on available data and certain assumptions about the property that have not been independently verified.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-body-color">6. Assumptions and Conditions</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-body-color">
                All desktop valuations are based on the assumption that the property is legally owned by the 
                client or the party who has ordered the valuation, is free from encumbrances, and complies with local legal and regulatory requirements.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-body-color">
                We are not responsible for verifying legal ownership or identifying technical issues related to the property.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-body-color">7. Fees and Payment</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-body-color">
                Fees for desktop valuation services are to be paid in full at the time of order. 
                All fees are non-refundable once the valuation report has been delivered.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-body-color">8. Liability Limitation</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-body-color">
                Desktop Valuation and its team are not liable for any discrepancies between the 
                desktop valuation and an actual physical valuation. The use of the valuation report is at the clientâ€™s discretion and responsibility.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-body-color">
                The maximum liability for any claim arising from the valuation service is limited to the amount paid for the service.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-body-color">
                We are not liable for any indirect or consequential damages arising from the use of our valuation reports.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-body-color">9. Confidentiality</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-body-color">
                The valuation report is confidential and intended only for the client 
                who has requested the service. It cannot be shared with or disclosed to third parties without prior written consent from Desktop Valuation, 
                except as required by law.
            </p>
